        <p> We are the Heart and Home team, we strive to protect stray animals who dont have a home. Life is very easy for a normal dog or cat. They never have to worry about being hungry, They live a very comfortable life, their owners they even give them a bath! These comforts are immidietly lost when an animals loses its home, This is very common especially in India

     <p>  You might think that to help you would have to some kind of superhero or you would require a huge invesment. Infact the opposite is true. It is not possible to bring every stray to your house and keep it as a pet. But it takes very little effort to buy some pet food and put it in a bowl on the streets. I am telling you the dogs will love it! You can even contact organizations like PETA</p>
